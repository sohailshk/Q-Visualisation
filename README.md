# Q* Value Visualization Notebook

This notebook is designed to help users visualize the **Q*** algorithm, a key concept in Reinforcement Learning (RL). By allowing users to input important parameters such as the terminal state and the discount factor, the notebook offers a dynamic view of how the Q-value evolves towards the optimal solution, influenced by the reward function.

## Key Features:
- **Interactive Inputs:** Users can specify the terminal state and adjust the discount factor (γ) to observe its effect on the learning process.
- **Dynamic Visualization:** The notebook provides real-time updates, visualizing how the Q-value converges towards the optimal action-value as the algorithm maximizes rewards.
- **Reward Function Insight:** Through visualization, users can explore how different reward structures impact the algorithm's decision-making and Q-value updates.

## How It Works:
1. **State Terminal:** Users input the terminal state to define the end of the episode.
2. **Discount Factor (γ):** The discount factor, which controls the influence of future rewards, can be adjusted interactively.
3. **Q-value Updates:** Watch how the Q-value adjusts as the agent learns the optimal policy to maximize cumulative reward over time.

## Purpose:
This notebook serves as a hands-on tool for visualizing the **Q*** algorithm in action. It provides a clearer understanding of how reinforcement learning agents update their state-action pairs, converge on the optimal policy, and balance immediate versus long-term rewards through the reward function.

## Getting Started:
- Install the required libraries (add a `requirements.txt` or mention them here).
- Run the notebook in a compatible environment (Jupyter, Colab, etc.).
- Experiment with different terminal states and discount factors to observe the impact on the Q-value.
